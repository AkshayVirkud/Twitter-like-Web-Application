An online social networking web-application similar to Twitter as a part of **Management of Software Engineering** course (Fall 2014) using **ASP.Net 4.5, JavaScript, SQL Server 2008, Amazon Web Services and Android**

The goal of this project is to create a Twitter-like Application for web browsers and mobile application. The users should be able to tweet form a web browser. They should be allowed to tweet from a mobile device. Tweets at one place should be seen in the other.
